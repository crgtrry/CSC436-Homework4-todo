## Todo
Uncomplete:
  Failed to produce a list of Todo items
  Did not get to adding Todo items
  Did not get to perform update.
  No extra credit tasks were accomplished

## Project
To run project:
In Dist directory run: http-server dist/todo

## Challenges
I got bogged down with data binding.  Could not produce a list of todo items before time ran out and that held up getting on tasks that were dependent on the list.
Estimated time on project: 6.5 hours

## Build
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4.


Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
